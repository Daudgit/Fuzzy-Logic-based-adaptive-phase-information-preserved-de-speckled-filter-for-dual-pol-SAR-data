## Description
In the proposed method, a fuzzy logic (FL) based adaptive weighted despeckling approach is employed to handle uncertainties and process each pixel uniquely based on its properties. FL is chosen due to its capability to handle uncertainties effectively.

For the implementation of the FL-based despeckling strategy, a set of 125 novel fuzzy inference (FI) rules has been designed. These rules serve as guidelines for the FL system to determine the appropriate weights for despeckling each pixel. The output of the FL system is the weight, which is the linguistic variable indicating the level of speckle noise to be removed.

To define the input linguistic variables, different combinations of scattering properties are considered. These scattering properties reflect the varied characteristics of land covers from which the electromagnetic waves are reflected back in SAR images.
